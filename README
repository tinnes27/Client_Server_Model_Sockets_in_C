Client_Server_Model_Sockets_in_C

This project implements interprocess communication via the client-server model.  These sockets are written in the C programming language.  This is a back account application whereby a client may access their account balance and check to see hoe many times their balance information has been accessed.  The TCP persistent protocol is implemented in this project.  The client needs to know the dotted quad IP address of the server and the port number.  A client may access 4 accounts, myChecking,  mySavings, myRetirement, and myCollege.  Action flag parameters include BAL and COUNT for account balance and access count respectively.  

For example  
Server call:  ./changeServer 6000

Client call:  ./nameChanger myChecking 23.23.23.23 6000 BAL

Sample output:

MyChecking
AccountBalance is 200
